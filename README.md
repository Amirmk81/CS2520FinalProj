# Cannon Project

Project Description:
Final Assignment of CS2520 Group Members: Matthew Cheser, Amir Kouhpainejad, and Kevin Kongwattanachai



The Cannon Game project is a continuation of the project that we did in class. The assignment tasks are as follows:

Implement various types of projectiles.
Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.


Run the main.py in the "game" folder to start the application.

Use 'A' and 'D' to move, spacebar to shoot. 
The Direction and speed of the projectile will depend on the mouse location.
